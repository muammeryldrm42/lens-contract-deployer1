# Lens Deployer â€” Offline-Friendly
This bundle helps when CDN links are blocked. It can load the Solidity compiler in 3 ways:
1) Add `solc.min.js` next to `index.html`
2) Or add `soljson.js` + `wrapper.js` next to `index.html`
3) Or paste the content of a solc browser build into the textarea and click **Load From Paste**

After the `Compiler status` shows green, use Deploy + Mint as usual.
